## ConstraintsFixer
some mods can trigger an error that results in constraints not executing at the right time, and not following IK. 
This fixes that.

## FastNetIK
Use the Unity jobs system for remote players' network IK, making it faster.
Adds the option to send finger spread information, but that requires the receiving side to have the mod too, and to enable both the "deserializer" and the "send finger spread" option.

## FixDbLoadLag
Fix the lag spike when loading avatars with dynamic bone components on it.

## ~~FixLegCalibration~~
Fix leg calibration issues in full body tracking. No longer needed as it's implemented in the game, kept here for reference.

## MemoryCache
Replace the way the game is handling dowloading, loading, hashing, decrypting, and caching avatars and props. 
Eliminates lagspikes on load, makes avatar switching to avatars and spwaning props that already have been seen before almost instantaneous.

## Advanced Safety performance fix
Fix a performance issue with Advanced Safety related to checking materials.
