# Universal Unity game mod

## RyzenAffinity
Sets the affinity of the game to the first CCX for AMD Ryzen CPUs. Doesn't do anything if any other CPU is used.

# ChilloutVR mods
Not affiliated with or supported by ChilloutVR or Alpha Blend Interactive.

## ConstraintsFixer
Some mods can trigger an error that results in constraints not executing at the right time, and not following IK. 
This fixes that.

## MenuDisable
Disable the update of the quick menu and the main menu when they are not in view.

Updated/recompiled for new CVR version:

## FastNetIK
Use the Unity jobs system for remote players' network IK, making it faster.
Adds the option to send finger spread information, but that requires the receiving side to have the mod too, and to enable both the "deserializer" and the "send finger spread" option.

## FixDbLoadLag
Fix the lag spike when loading avatars with dynamic bone components on it.

## Advanced Safety performance fix
Fix a performance issue with Advanced Safety related to checking materials.

# Not updated CVR mods

## ~~FixLegCalibration~~
Fix leg calibration issues in full body tracking. No longer needed as it's implemented in the game, kept here for reference.

## MemoryCache 
Replace the way the game is handling dowloading, loading, hashing, decrypting, and caching avatars and props. 
Eliminates lagspikes on load, makes avatar switching to avatars and spwaning props that already have been seen before almost instantaneous.
(not sure if I will update it for the new game version)
